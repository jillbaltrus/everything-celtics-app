# Everything Celtics App

## This is a work in progress app that will (eventually) let users access interesting Celtics data!

### Description

This simple React Native app will be able to make calls to my <a href="https://github.com/jillbaltrus/node-celtics-server">Node server I built for this project
</a>. It has 3 key usages:

### Exploring Players
Users will be able to see a list of all Celtics players per season and search them by last name.
They will also be able to navigate to a Player Details page for each player, which have more in-depth
information about the player and include statistics about their performance.

### Exploring Games
Users will be able to see a list of all Celtics games per season and organize them by different criteria,
such as previous/upcoming, outcome, and opponent. They will be able to navigate to a Game Details page
for each game, which more detailed information and statistics about the game.

### Exploring Statistics
Users will be able to see interesting stats about the Celtics' performance per season,
such as total games, biggest league, plus/minus, standing in the standard league.

### Done So Far
As of 6/19/23, the overrall app structure is done, including navigation and the basic pages. I have also created the service with
all the necessary API calls. The Players screen is close to done (search feature and player list), but the remaining pages still
have a long way to go. I'm off to a good start, but it will be a long road.
